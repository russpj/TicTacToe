TicTacToe

This is a bed for machine learning.

Currently it knows the rules of TicTacToe, and
allows two humans to play the game. 

Command Line: python game.py

To be added: You know, actual machine learning

I think we'll model the machine learning after this [pile of matchboxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9c-_neaxeU).
